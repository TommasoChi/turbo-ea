 *   - `RouteGuard` (`components/RouteGuard.tsx`) wraps the authenticated route
 *     table, so typing a URL is gated exactly like clicking the nav item;
 *   - `SsoCallback` asks, before redirecting a freshly signed-in user to the
 *     page they originally asked for, whether they can actually open it.
 *
 * `AppLayout`'s nav definitions derive their permissions from here too, so the
 * menu and the router can never disagree about what a page needs.
 *
 * A path that is absent from this table is ungated — see
 * `INTENTIONALLY_UNGATED` below, and the parity test in
 * `routePermissions.test.ts` that stops a new route from being added without a
 * decision either way.
