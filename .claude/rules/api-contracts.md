# API contracts: routes, schemas and the OpenAPI spec

- **A request/response contract change starts in `backend/app/schemas/`, not in the route handler.** Define
  or edit the Pydantic model first; the handler only ever consumes an already-validated schema instance,
  never a raw `dict`/`Any` reconstructed inline. The one deliberate exception is a card's `attributes`
  (`dict | None`, `field_validator` via `_validate_jsonb_dict`) — the data-driven metamodel means custom
  field keys are admin-configured, not fixed at the schema level, so `dict` there is correct, not a
  shortcut.
- **A route handler is a controller: parse/validate the request, check permissions, call a service, return
  the response. Business logic, transaction orchestration and side effects (writes, event emission,
  notifications) belong in `backend/app/services/`, never inline in the handler.** This is the same
  **"B0-style extraction"** pattern already named in `.claude/rules/extensions-sdk-bridges.md` —
  `card_write_service.py`, `adr_service.py`, `risk_service.py`, `survey_service.py` are the shared service
  functions both the REST routes and the extension SDK bridges call, so a human write and an extension
  write run identical validation, hierarchy guards and event emission. `create_card` in `cards.py` is the
  reference shape: permission check → readability check → `card_write_service.create_card(...)` → commit →
  re-fetch → response. **This does not ban a private response-shaping helper in the route file itself**
  (`_card_to_response`, `_cost_redaction_map` in `cards.py` are fine — they format an already-fetched,
  already-committed result, they do not decide anything) — the line is business rules and side effects, not
  every local function.
- **Any new or changed route means a regenerated OpenAPI spec, before opening the PR**: run
  `python scripts/dump_openapi.py` and commit `docs/api/openapi.json` as part of the same change, not as a
  follow-up fix once CI's `OpenAPI Spec` job fails the PR for drift. `docs/api/openapi.json` is generated
  from `app.main:app` and rendered in the user manual at `/admin/api/` via Swagger UI (loaded from the
  `swagger-ui-dist` CDN, same UI as FastAPI's `/api/docs`) — never hand-edit it. The committed spec is
  **version-agnostic**: `dump_openapi.py` normalises `info.version` to the constant `"latest"` before
  writing, so a VERSION-only diff never causes CI drift (the live runtime spec at `/api/openapi.json` keeps
  the real version — `app.openapi()` direct). There is intentionally no pre-commit hook for this — the
  script imports the whole backend app and not every `backend/**` commit should pay that cost; CI fails a
  PR whose spec has drifted, and a push to `main` auto-regenerates it via the `openapi-spec` workflow job,
  so a forgotten regen is recoverable there too.
